# user_application

A new EcoBin application based on Third year project of Robotics and Automation Engineering (Phumin "HourCode" Udomdach)

## setup

first you should install firebase cli and doing like in the docs (just googling it)

second you should install firebase_core and cloud_firestore


## Error Fix

### Flutter
try to update the latest version of flutter or android SDK by using flutter doctor or flutter doctor -v for more detail
also try to clean up old build by using flutter clean and flutter pub get to get the latest package version too

### GRADLE
if you get error with gradle, try to check java version and fix it in android studio
also if you get error that can't build app, you should delete gradle folder in android -> app (not cause any problem because the project will generate for you later)
